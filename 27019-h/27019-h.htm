<h1><big>My<br />
Shipmate&mdash;<br />
Columbus</big></h1>

<h2><small>By STEPHEN WILDER</small></h2>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i><big>We've been taught from childhood
that the earth is round and
that Columbus discovered America.
But maybe we take too much
on faith. This first crossing
for instance. Were you there?
Did you see Columbus land?
Here's the story of a man who
can give us the straight facts.</big></i></p></div>

<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">The</span> laughter brought spots
of color to his cheeks. He
stood there for a while, taking
it, and then decided he had
had enough and would sit
down. A whisper of amusement
still stirred the room as
he returned to his seat and
the professor said,</p>

<p>"But just a moment, Mr.
Jones. Won't you tell the class
what makes you think Columbus
was not the 'bold skipper'
the history books say he was.
After all, Mr. Jones, this is a
history class. If you know
more or better history than
the history books do, isn't it
your duty to tell us?"</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/001.png" width="600" height="544" alt="" title="" />
<b><small>He clutched at his slashed veins and snarled into the face of death.</small></b></div>

<p>"I didn't say he <i>wasn't</i>,"
Danny Jones said desperately
as the laughter started again.
Some profs were like that, he
thought. Picking on one student
and making the rest of
the class laugh and think
what a great guy the prof was
and what a prize dodo the
hapless student was. "I said,"
Danny went on doggedly,
"Columbus might not have
been&mdash;maybe wasn't&mdash;the
bold skipper the history books
claim he was. I can't prove it.
No one can. I haven't a time
machine."</p>

<p>Again it was the wrong
thing to say. The professor
wagged a finger in front of
his face and gave Danny a sly
look. "Don't you," he said,
"don't you indeed? I was beginning
to think you had been
willed H. G. Wells' famous
literary invention, young
man." That one had the class
all but rolling in the aisles.</p>

<p>Danny said desperately,
"No! No, I mean, they don't
even know for sure if Columbus
was born in Genoa. They
just think he was. So they also
could be wrong about&mdash;"</p>

<p>Abruptly the professor's
face went serious. "My dear
Mr. Jones," he said slowly,
acidly, "don't you think we've
had enough of fantasy? Don't
you think we ought to return
to history?"</p>

<p>Danny sat down and for a
moment shut his eyes but remained
conscious of everyone
looking at him, staring at
him, evaluating. It wasn't so
easy, he decided, being a sophomore
transfer student from
a big city college, where almost
everything went and
there was a certain amount of
anonymity in the very size of
the classes, to a small town
college where every face,
after a week or so, was familiar.
Danny wished he had
kept his big yap shut about
Columbus, but it was too late
now. They'd be ribbing him
for weeks....</p>

<p>On his way back to the
dorm after classes he was
hailed by a student who lived
down the hall from him, a
fellow named Groves, who
said, "How's the boy, Danny.
Next thing you'll tell us is
that Cortez was really a sexy
Spanish broad with a thirty-eight
bust who conquered
Montezuma and his Indians
with sex appeal. Get it, boy. I
said&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Aw, lay off," Danny grumbled.</p>

<p>The other boy laughed,
then shrugged, then said, "Oh
yeah, forgot to tell you.
There's a telegram waiting
for you in the dorm. House-mother's
got it. Well, see you,
Vasco da Gama."</p>

<p>Danny trudged on to the
Georgian-style dormitory and
went inside, through the lobby
and behind the stairs to
the house-mother's office at
the rear of the building. She
was a kindly-looking old
woman with a halo of white
hair and a smile which made
her a good copy of everyone's
grandmother. But now her
face was set in unexpectedly
grim lines. "Telegram for
you, Danny," she said slowly.
"They read it over the telephone
first, then delivered it."
She held out a yellow envelope.
"I'm afraid it's some
bad news, Danny." She
seemed somehow reluctant to
part with the little yellow envelope.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Danny said.</p>

<p>"You'd better read it yourself.
Here, sit down."</p>

<p>Danny nodded, took the envelope,
sat down and opened
it. He read, MR. DANNY
JONES, WHITNEY COLLEGE,
WHITNEY, VIRGINIA.
REGRET TO
INFORM YOU UNCLE
AVERILL PASSED AWAY
LAST NIGHT PEACEFULLY
IN HIS SLEEP LEAVING
UNSPECIFIED PROPERTY
TO YOU. It was
signed with a name Danny
did not recognize.</p>

<p>"I'm terribly sorry," the
house-mother said, placing
her hand on Danny's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right, Mrs.
Grange. It's all right. You see,
Uncle Averill wasn't a young
man. He must have been in
his eighties."</p>

<p>"Were you very close to
him, Danny?"</p>

<p>"No, not for a long time.
When I was a kid&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs. Grange smiled.</p>

<p>"Well, when I was eight or
nine, I used to see him all the
time. We stayed at his place
on the coast near St. Augustine,
Florida, for a year. I&mdash;I
feel sorry about Uncle
Averill, Mrs. Grange, but I
feel better about something
that happened in class today.
I&mdash;I think Uncle Averill
would have approved of how I
acted."</p>

<p>"Want to talk about it?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's just he always
said never to take any so-called
fact for granted, especially
in history. I can almost
remember his voice now, the
way he used to say, 'if ever
there's an argument in history,
sonny, all you ever get
is the propaganda report of
the side which won.' You
know, Mrs. Grange, I think
he was right. Of course, a lot
of folks thought old Uncle
Averill was a little queer.
Touched in the head is what
they said."</p>

<p>"They oughtn't to say such
things."</p>

<p>"Always tinkering around
in his basement. Funny, nobody
ever knew on what. He
wouldn't let anybody near the
place. He had a time lock and
everything. What nobody
could figure out is if he was
trying so hard to guard something
that was in the basement,
why did he sometimes
disappear for weeks on end
without even telling anybody
where he went. And I remember,"
Danny went on musing,
"every time he came back he
went into that harangue
about history, as if somehow
he had confirmed his suspicions.
He was a funny old
guy but I liked him."</p>

<p>"You remembering him so
vividly after all these years
will be the best epitaph your
uncle could have, Danny. But
what are you going to do?
About what he left you, I
mean."</p>

<p>"Uncle Averill always liked
promptness. If he left something
for me, he'd want me to
pick it up immediately. I
guess I ought to go down
there to St. Augustine as fast
as I can."</p>

<p>"But your classes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'll have to take an emergency
leave of absence."</p>

<p>"Under the circumstances,
I'm sure the college will approve.
Do you think your
uncle left you anything&mdash;well&mdash;important?"</p>

<p>"Important?" Danny repeated
the word. "No, I don't
think so. Not by the world's
standards. But it must have
been important to Uncle
Averill. He was a&mdash;you know,
an image-breaker&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An iconoclast," supplied
Mrs. Grange.</p>

<p>"Yes'm, an iconoclast. But
I liked him."</p>

<p>Mrs. Grange nodded.
"You'd better get over and
see the Dean."</p>

<p>An hour later, Danny was
at the bus depot, waiting for
the Greyhound that would
take him over to Richmond,
where he would meet a train
for the south and Florida.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was a rambling white
stucco house with a red tile
roof and a pleasant grove of
palm trees in front and flame-red
hibiscus climbing the
stucco. The lawyer, whose
name was Tartalion, met him
at the door.</p>

<p>"I'll get right down to business,
Mr. Jones," Tartalion
said after they had entered
the house. "Your uncle wanted
it that way."</p>

<p>"Wait a minute," Danny
said, "don't tell me they already
had the funeral?"</p>

<p>"Your uncle didn't believe
in funerals. His will stipulated
cremation."</p>

<p>"But, it was so&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Sudden? I know, the will
wasn't officially probated. But
your uncle had a judge for a
friend, and under the circumstances,
his wishes were
granted. Now, then, you know
why you're here?"</p>

<p>"You mean, what he left
me? I thought I'd at least get
to see his&mdash;"</p>

<p>"His body? Not your uncle,
not old Averill Jones. You
ought to know better. Sonny,"
the lawyer asked abruptly,
"how well did you know the
old man?"</p>

<p>The sonny rankled. After
all, Danny thought, I'm nineteen.
I like beer and girls and
I'm no sonny anymore. He
sighed and thought of his history
class, then thought of
Uncle Averill's opinion of history,
and felt better. He explained
the relationship to
Mr. Tartalion and waited for
the lawyer to speak.</p>

<p>"Well, it beats me," Tartalion
admitted. "Why he left
it to a nephew he hasn't seen
in ten or eleven years, I mean.
Don't just look at me like
that. You know that contraption
he had in the basement,
don't you? How he wouldn't
let a soul near it, ever? Then
tell me something, Danny.
Why did he leave it to you?"</p>

<p>"You're joking!" Danny
cried.</p>

<p>"I was your uncle's lawyer.
I wouldn't joke about it. He
said it was the only thing he
had worth willing. He said he
willed it to you. Want me to
read you the clause?"</p>

<p>Danny nodded. He felt
strangely flattered, because
the contraption in Averill
Jones' basement&mdash;a contraption
which no one but Averill
Jones had ever seen&mdash;had
been the dearest thing in the
old bachelor's life. Actually,
he was not Danny's uncle, but
his grand-uncle. He had lived
alone in St. Augustine and
had liked living alone. The
only relative he had tolerated
was Danny, when Danny was
a small boy. Then, as Danny
approached his ninth birthday,
the old man had said,
"They're teaching you too
much at school, son. Too many
wrong things, too many highfalutin'
notions, too much just
plain old hogwash. Why don't
you kind of make yourself
scarce for a few years?" It
had been blunt and to the
point. It had made Danny cry.
He hadn't thought of what
had happened that last day
he'd seen his grand-uncle for
years, but he thought of it
now.</p>

<hr />

<p>"But why can't I come back
and see you?" he had asked
tearfully.</p>

<p>"On account of the machine,
son."</p>

<p>"But <i>why</i>, uncle?"</p>

<p>"Hey, come on now and
stop your blubbering all over
me. If you can't you can't."</p>

<p>"You have to tell me why!"</p>

<p>"Stubborn little critter.
Well, I like that. All right,
I'll tell you why. Because the
machine has a funny kind of
fuel, that's why. It doesn't
run on gasoline, Danny, or
anything like that."</p>

<p>"What does it do, uncle?"</p>

<p>But the old man had shaken
his head. "Maybe someday
after I'm gone you'll find out.
If anyone finds out, it will be
you, and that's a promise."</p>

<p>"You still didn't tell me
why I have to go away."</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;well, don't go
telling this to your folks, son,
or they'll think old Uncle
Averill has a screw loose
somewheres&mdash;because that
machine I have downstairs
runs on faith. On faith, you
understand? Oh, not the kind
of faith they think is important
and do a lot of talking
and sermoning about, but a
different kind of faith. Personal
faith, you might say.
Faith in a dream or a belief,
no matter what people think.
And&mdash;you know what ruins
that faith?"</p>

<p>"No," Danny had said, his
eyes very big.</p>

<p>"Knowledge!" cried his
uncle. "Too much so-called
knowledge which isn't knowledge
at all, but hearsay.
That's what they're teaching
you. In school, other places,
every day of your life. I'll tell
you when you can come back,
Danny: when you're ready to
throw most of it overboard.
All right?"</p>

<p>He had had to say all right.
It was the last time he had
ever seen his uncle, but those
weren't the last words Averill
Jones had spoken to him, for
the old man had added as he
got up to go: "Don't forget,
son. Don't let them pull the
wool over your eyes. History
is propaganda&mdash;from a winner's
point of view. If a side
lost the war and got stamped
on, you never see the war
from its point of view. If an
idea got out of favor and
stamped on, the idea is ridiculed.
Don't forget it, son. If
you believe something, if you
<i>know</i> it's right, have faith in
it and don't give a mind what
people say. Promise?"</p>

<p>Danny, his eyes stinging
with tears because somehow
he could sense he would
never see Uncle Averill again,
had said that he promised.</p>

<p>"... to my nephew, Danny
Jones," the lawyer was reading.
"So, you see, you'll have
to go right down there and
look the thing over. Naturally,
I'll have to leave the house
while you do so and I won't
be able to return until you
tell me I can&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"Weren't you listening?"</p>

<p>"I guess I was thinking
about my uncle."</p>

<p>"Well, the clause says
you're to examine the machine
alone, with no one else
in the house. It's perfectly legal.
If that's what your uncle
wanted, that's what he'll get.
Are you all set?"</p>

<p>Danny nodded and Tartalion
shook his hand solemnly,
then left the room. Danny
heard the lawyer's footsteps
receding, heard the front door
open and close, heard a car
engine start. Then, slowly, he
walked through the living
room of his dead uncle's
house and across the long,
narrow kitchen and to the
basement stairs. His hands
were very dry and he felt his
heart thudding. He was nervous,
which surprised him.</p>

<hr />

<p>But why? he thought, why
should it surprise me? All my
life, Uncle Averill's basement
has been a mystery. Let's face
it, Danny-boy, you haven't
exactly had an adventurous
life. Maybe Uncle Averill was
the biggest adventure in it,
with his secret machine and
strange disappearances. And
maybe Uncle Averill did a
good selling job when you
were small, because that machine
means mystery to you.
It's probably not much more
than a better mousetrap, but
you want to believe it is, don't
you? And you're nervous because
the way Uncle Averill
kept you and anyone else
away from his basement
when you were a kid makes
it a kind of frightening place,
even now.</p>

<p>He opened the basement
door with a key which the
lawyer had given him. Beyond
the door were five steps
and another door&mdash;this one of
metal. It had had a time lock
in the old days, Danny remembered,
but the lock was
gone now. The metal door
swung ponderously, like the
door to a bank vault, and then
Danny was on the other side.
It was dark down there, but
faint light seeped in through
small high windows and in a
few moments Danny's eyes
grew accustomed to the
gloom.</p>

<p>The basement was empty
except for what looked like a
big old steamer trunk in the
center of the dusty cement
floor.</p>

<p>Danny was disappointed.
He had childhood visions of
an intricate maze of machinery
cluttering up every available
square foot of basement
space, but now he knew that
whatever it was which had
taken up so much of Uncle
Averill's time could fit in the
odd-looking steamer trunk in
the center of the floor and
thus wasn't too much bigger
than a good-size TV set. He
walked slowly to the trunk
and stood for a few moments
over the lid. It was an ancient-looking
steamer: Uncle
Averill must have owned it
since his own youth. Still,
just a plain trunk.</p>

<p>Danny was in no hurry to
open the lid, which did not
seem to be locked. For a few
moments, at least, he could
shield himself from further
disappointment&mdash;because
now he had a hunch that
Uncle Averill's machine was
going to be a first-class dud.
Maybe, he thought gloomily,
Uncle Averill had simply not
liked to be with people and
had used the ruse of a bank-vault
door and an empty
steamer trunk to achieve privacy
whenever he felt the
need for it.</p>

<p>Remembering the history
class, Danny decided that&mdash;after
all&mdash;sometimes that
wasn't a bad idea. Finally, he
called himself a fool for waiting
and threw up the trunk-lid.</p>

<p>A small case was all he saw
inside, although the interior
of the trunk was larger than
he had expected. A man could
probably curl up in there
quite comfortably. But the
case&mdash;the case looked exactly
like it ought to house a tape-recorder.</p>

<p>Danny reached in and hauled
out the case. It was heavy,
about as heavy as a tape-recorder
ought to be. Danny
placed it down on the floor
and opened it.</p>

<p>What he saw was a battery-powered
tape-recorder. His
disappointment increased:
Uncle Averill had left a message
for him, that was all.
Dutifully, however, he set the
spools and snapped on the
switch.</p>

<p>A voice from yesterday&mdash;Uncle
Averill's voice&mdash;spoke
to him.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Hallo, Danny," it said.
"The way the years roll by, I
forget exactly how old you
are, boy. Seventeen? Eighteen?
Twenty? Well, it doesn't
matter&mdash;if you still believe.
If you have faith. Faith in
what? Maybe now you're old
enough to know. I mean faith
in&mdash;not having faith. That is,
faith in not taking faithfully
all the silly items of knowledge
they try to cram down
your throat in school. See
what I mean? Remember
what I always said about history,
Danny: you get propaganda,
is all, from the
winning side. If you got faith
enough in yourself, Danny,
faith enough not to believe
everything the history books
tell you, that's the kind of
faith I mean. Because such a
faith gave me the most interesting
life a man ever lived,
make no mistake about that.</p>

<p>"I'm dead, Danny. Yep, old
Uncle Averill is dead. Because
this tape-recorder won't be
left you in my will until I am
dead. But, no regrets, boy. I
had a great life. How great&mdash;nobody
knows. Only you,
you're about to find out. Do
you believe? Do you believe
the way I have in mind?
Make no mistake about it
now, son. If you don't believe,
you might as well burn these
spools and go home."</p>

<p>Danny considered. He remembered
what had happened
in his history class.
Wasn't that the sort of faith
Uncle Averill had in mind?
Faith not to believe in historical
fairy tales? Faith to
doubt when one ought to
doubt? Faith to be skeptical....</p>

<p>"Good," said the voice from
the past. "Then you're still
here. Look in front of you,
Danny-boy. The trunk. The
old steamer. Know what it
is?"</p>

<p>"No," Danny said, then
clamped a hand over his
mouth. For a moment he had
actually believed he was talking
to the dead man.</p>

<p>"It's a time machine," said
his Uncle's voice.</p>

<p>There was a silence. The
tape went on winding. For a
moment, Danny thought that
was all. Then the voice continued:
"No, your old grand-uncle
isn't nuts, Danny. It's
a time machine. I know it's a
time machine because I used
it all my life. You expected
some kind of complicated gadget
down here, I know. I made
everybody think it was a gadget.
Going down to your basement
and tinkering with a
gadget is fine in our culture.
Hell's fire, boy, it's approved
behavior. But locking a bank-vault
door behind you and
curling up in a steamer trunk,
that isn't approved. Now, is
it?</p>

<p>"I'll tell you about this here
time machine, sonny. It isn't
a machine at all, in the strict
sense of the word. You can
see that. It's just&mdash;well, an
empty box. But it works, and
what else ought a fellow to
care about.</p>

<p>"Funny how I got it. I was
eighteen or twenty, maybe.
And my Grand-uncle Daniel
gave it to me. Daniel, get me.
Daniel to Averill to Daniel. So
when you have a grand-nephew,
see that his name's
Averill, understand? Keep it
going, Danny. Because this
trunk is old. A lot older than
you think.</p>

<p>"And you can travel
through time in it. Don't look
at me like that, I know what
you're thinking. There isn't
any such thing as time travel.
In the strict sense of the
word, it's impossible. You
can't resurrect the past or
peek into the unborn future.
Well, I don't know about the
future, but I do know about
the past. But you got to have
faith, you got to be a kid at
heart, Danny. You got to have
this dream, see?</p>

<p>"Because you don't travel
anywhere. But your mind
does, and it's like you wake
up in somebody else's body,
drawn to him like a magnet,
somebody else&mdash;some<i>when</i>
else. Your body stays right
here, you see. In the trunk. In
what they called suspended
animation. But you&mdash;the real
you, the you that knows how
to dream and to believe&mdash;you
go back.</p>

<p>"Don't make the mistake I
made at first. It's no dream in
the usual sense of the word.
It's real, Danny. You're somebody
else back there, all right,
but if he gets hurt, you get
hurt. If he dies&mdash;taps for
Danny Jones! You get me?"</p>

<hr />

<p>The dead man's voice
chuckled. "But don't think
this means automatically
you'll be able to travel
through time. Because you got
to have the proper attitude.
You've got to believe in yourself,
and not in all the historical
fictions they give you.
Now do you understand? If
you're skeptical enough and if
at the same time you like to
dream enough&mdash;that's all it
takes. Want to try it?"</p>

<p>Suddenly the voice was
gone. That was all there was
and at first Danny could not
believe it. A sense of bitter
disappointment enveloped
him&mdash;not because
Uncle Averill had left him
nothing but an old steamer
trunk but because Uncle
Averill had been, to say the
least, off his rocker.</p>

<p>The fabulous machine in
the basement was&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>Just a steamer trunk and
an incredible story about
time-traveling.</p>

<p>Danny sighed and began to
walk back toward the cellar
stairs. He paused. He turned
around uncertainly and looked
at the trunk. After all, he
had promised; at least he'd
promised himself that he'd
carry out his peculiar uncle's
wishes. Besides, he'd come all
the way down here from
Whitney College and he ought
to at least try the machine.</p>

<p>But there wasn't any machine.</p>

<p>Try the trunk then? There
was nothing to try except
curling up in it and maybe
closing the lid. Uncle Averill
was a practical joker, too. It
might be just like Uncle
Averill to have the lid snap
shut and lock automatically so
Danny would have to pound
his knuckles black and blue
until the lawyer heard and
came for him.</p>

<p>You see, sonny? would be
Uncle Averill's point. You believed
me, and you should
have known better.</p>

<p>Danny cursed himself and
returned to the trunk. He
gazed down at the yawning
interior for a few seconds,
then put first one foot, then
the other over the side. He sat
down and stared at a peeling
blue-paper liner. He rolled
over and curled up. The bottom
of the trunk was a good
fit. He reached up and found
a rope dangling down toward
him. He pulled the lid down,
smiling at his own credulity,
and was engulfed in total
darkness.</p>

<p>But it would be wonderful,
he found himself thinking. It
would be the most wonderful
thing in the world, to be able
to travel through time and see
for yourself what really had
happened in all the world's
colorful ages and to take part
in the wildest, proudest adventures
of mankind.</p>

<p>He thought, I want to believe.
It would be so wonderful
to believe.</p>

<p>He also thought about his
history class. He did not know
it, but his history class was
very important. It was crucial.
Everything depended on
his history class. Because he
doubted. He did not want to
take Columbus' bravery and
intelligence for granted.
There were no surviving documents,
so why should he?</p>

<p>Maybe Columbus was a
third-rater!</p>

<p>Maybe&mdash;at least you didn't
have to worship him as a hero
just because he happened to
discover ...</p>

<p>Now, what did he discover?</p>

<p>In absolute darkness and a
ringing in the ears and far
away a dim glowing light and
larger and brighter and the
whirling whirling spinning
flashing I don't believe but
strangely somehow I have
faith, faith in myself, buzzing,
humming, glowing ...</p>

<p>The world exploded.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of
laughter in the tavern.</p>

<p>At first he thought the
laughter was directed at him.
Giddily, he raised his head.
He saw raw wood rafters, a
leaded glass window, a
stained and greasy wall,
heavy wood-plank tables with
heavy chairs and a barbarous-looking
crew drinking from
heavy clay mugs. One of the
mugs was in front of him and
he raised it to his lips without
thinking.</p>

<p>It was ale, the strongest ale
he had ever tasted. He got it
down somehow without gagging.
The laughter came
again, rolling over him like a
wave. A serving girl scurried
by, skirts flashing, a rough
tray of clay mugs balanced
expertly on one hand. A man
with a sword dangling at his
side staggered to his feet
drunkenly and clawed at the
girl, but she shoved him back
into his seat and kept walking.</p>

<p>The third wave of laughter
rolled and then there was a
brief silence.</p>

<p>"Drink too much, Martin
Pinzon?" Danny's companion
at the long board-table asked.
He was an evil-looking old
man with a patch over one eye
and a small white spade-shaped
beard and unshaven
cheeks.</p>

<p>"Not me," Danny said,
amazed because the language
was unfamiliar to him yet he
could both understand and
speak it. "What's so funny?"
he asked. "Why's everyone
laughing?"</p>

<p>The old man's hand slapped
his back and the mouth parted
to show ugly blackened teeth
and the old man laughed so
hard spittle spotted his beard.
"As if you didn't know," he
managed to say. "As if you
didn't know, Martin Pinzon.
It's that weak-minded sailor
again, the one who claims to
have a charter for three
caravels from the Queen herself.
Drunk as Bacchus and
there's his pretty little daughter
trying to get him to come
home again. I tell you, Martin
Pinzon, if he isn't ..."</p>

<hr />

<p>But now Danny wasn't listening.
He looked around the
tavern until he saw the butt
of all the laughter. Slowly,
drawn irresistibly, Martin
Pinzon&mdash;or Danny Jones&mdash;got
up and walked over there.</p>

<p>The man was drunk as Bacchus,
all right. He was a man
perhaps somewhat taller than
average. He had a large head
with an arrogant beak of a
nose dominating the face, but
the mouth was weak and irresolute.
He stared drunkenly
at a beautiful girl who could
not have been more than seventeen.</p>

<p>The girl was saying,
"Please, papa. Come back to
the hotel with me. Papa, don't
you realize you're sailing tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Gowananlemebe," the man
mumbled.</p>

<p>"Papa. Please. The Queen's
charter&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was drunk when I took
it and drunk when I examined
those three stinking caravels
and&mdash;" he leaned forward as
if to speak in deepest confidence,
but his drunken voice
was still very loud&mdash;"and
drunk when I said the world
was round. I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You hear that?" someone
cried. "Old Chris was drunk
when he said the world was
round!"</p>

<p>"He must a' been!" someone
else shouted. Everyone
laughed.</p>

<p>"Come on, papa," the girl
pleaded. She wore a shawl
over her dress and another
shawl on her head. Her blonde
hair barely peeked out, and
she was beautiful. She tried
to drag her father to his feet
by one arm, but he was too
heavy for her.</p>

<p>She looked around the room
defiantly as the laughter
surged again. "Brave men!"
she mocked. "A bunch of stay-at-homes.
Won't somebody
help me? Papa sails tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Papa sails tomorrow,"
said someone, miming her
desperate tones. "Didn't you
know that papa sails tomorrow?"</p>

<p>"Not sailing anyplace at
all," the father mumbled.
"World isn't round. Drunk.
Think I want to fall over the
edge? Think I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, papa," moaned the
girl. "Won't someone help me
to&mdash;" And she tugged again
at the man's arm&mdash;"to get
him to bed."</p>

<p>A big man nearby boomed,
"I'll help you t'bed, me lass,
but it won't be with your old
father. Eh, mates?" he cried,
and the tavern echoed with
laughter. The big man got up
and went over to the girl.
"Now, listen, lass," he said,
taking hold of her arm. "Why
don't you forget this drunken
slob of a father and&mdash;"</p>

<p>Crack! Her hand blurred at
his cheek, struck it like a pistol
shot. The big man blinked
his eyes and grinned. "So you
have spirit, do you? Well, it's
more than I can say for that
father of yours, too yellow
and too drunk to carry out
the Queen of Castile's bid&mdash;"</p>

<p>The hand flashed out again
but this time the big man
caught it in one of his own
and twisted sideways against
the girl, forcing her back
against the table's edge. "I
like my girls to struggle," he
said, and the girl's face went
white as she suddenly let herself
go limp in his arms.</p>

<p>The man grinned. "Oh I
like 'em limp, me lass. When
they're pretty as a rose, like
you, who's to care?"</p>

<p>"Papa!" the girl screamed.
The big man's face hovered
over hers, blotting out the oil-lamp
lights, the thick lips all
but slavering....</p>

<hr />

<p>"Just a minute, man!" Danny cried,
striding boldly to
them. Hardly pausing in his
efforts to kiss the again struggling
girl, the big man swatted
back with one enormous
arm and sent Danny reeling.
Whoever he was, he was a
popular figure. The laughter
was still louder now. Everyone
was having a great time,
at Danny's expense now.</p>

<p>Danny crashed into a chair,
upending it. A bowl of soup
came crashing down, the
heavy bowl splintering, the
hot contents scalding him. He
stood up and heard the girl
scream. Instinctively, he
grasped two legs of the heavy
chair and hefted it. Then he
sprinted back across the
room.</p>

<p>"Behind you, Pietro!" a
voice cried, and at the last
moment the big man whirled
and faced Danny, then lunged
to one side, taking the girl
with him.</p>

<p>Danny couldn't check his
arms, which had carried the
heavy chair overhead. It came
down with a crash against the
edge of the big plank table.
The chair shattered in Danny's
arms. One leg flew up
and struck the big man in the
face, though, bringing blood
just below the cheek bone. He
bellowed in surprise and pain
and came lumbering toward
Danny.</p>

<p>Danny was aware of the
girl cowering to one side,
aware that another of the
chair's legs was still grasped
in his right hand. He was but
a boy, he found himself thinking
quickly, desperate. If the
giant grabbed him, grabbed
him just once, the fight would
be over. The man was twice
his size, twice his weight. Yet
he had to do something to
help the girl....</p>

<p>The giant came at him. The
big arms lifted over the
heavy, brutal face.... And
Danny drove under them with
the chair-leg, jabbing the tip
of it against the man's enormous
middle. Pietro&mdash;for
such was the man's name&mdash;sagged
a few inches, the
breath rushing, heavy with
garlic, from his mouth. But
still, he got his great hands
about Danny's throat and began
to squeeze.</p>

<p>Danny saw the wood rafters,
the window, a bargirl
standing, mouth open, watching
them, the drunken man
and his daughter, then a blurry,
watery confusion as his
eyes went dim. He was conscious
of swinging the club,
of striking something, of extending
the club out as far as
it would go and then slamming
it back toward himself,
striking something which he
hoped was Pietro's head. He
felt his mouth going slack and
wondered if his tongue were
hanging out. Exerting all his
strength he struck numbly,
mechanically, desperately
with the chair-leg.</p>

<p>And slowly, the constriction
left his throat. Something
struck against his middle,
almost knocking him
down. Something pushed
against his legs, backing him
against the table. He looked
down. His eyes were watery,
his throat burning. The giant
Pietro lay, breathing stertorously,
at his feet.</p>

<p>A small hand grabbed his.
"Father will come now," a
voice said. "I don't&mdash;don't
even know who you are, but I
want to thank you. I thank
you for myself and the Queen,
and God, senor. You better
come quickly, with us. Does it
hurt much?"</p>

<p>Danny tried to talk. His
voice rasped in his throat.
The girl squeezed his hand
and together with her and the
drunken man who was her
father, he left the tavern. The
giant Pietro was just getting
up and shaking his fist at
them slowly....</p>

<hr />

<p>It was a small top-floor
room in an old waterfront
building in the Spanish port
of Palos. Or, Danny corrected
himself, the Castillian port of
Palos. Because, in this year of
our Lord 1492, Spain had
barely become a unified
country.</p>

<p>"Are you feeling better,
Martin Pinzon?" the beautiful
girl asked him.</p>

<p>He had given the name he
had heard, Martin Pinzon, as
his own. The room was very
hot. The August night outside
was hot too and sultry and
starless. The girl's father was
resting now, breathing unevenly.
The girl's name was
Nina. One of the small caravels
in her father's three-ship
fleet was named after her.
Her full name was Nina
Columbus.</p>

<p>Nina brought another wet
cloth and covered Danny's
swollen throat with it. "Does
it hurt much?" she said, and,
for the tenth time, "we have
no money to thank you with,
senor."</p>

<p>"Any man would have&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you were the only one.
The only&mdash;never mind. Martin,
listen. I have no right to
trouble you, but ... it's
father. Tomorrow is the second
day of August, you see,
and it is all over Palos that
tomorrow he sails with the
Queen's charter...."</p>

<p>"Then if you're worrying
about that big man, Pietro,
you can forget it. If you're
sailing, I mean."</p>

<p>"That's just it," Nina said
desperately. "Father doesn't
want to sail. Martin, tell me,
do you believe the world is
round?"</p>

<p>Danny nodded very soberly.
"Yes, Nina," he told her softly.
"The world is round. I believe it."</p>

<p>"My father doesn't! Funny,
isn't it, Martin?" she said in
a voice which told him she
did not think it was funny at
all. "All Spain&mdash;and Genoa
too&mdash;think that tomorrow
morning my father, Christopher
Columbus, will journey
to the unexplored west confident
that he will arrive, after
a long voyage, in the East&mdash;when
really my father, this
same Christopher Columbus,
lies here in a drunken stupor
because he lacks the courage
to face his convictions and ...
oh, Martin!" Her voice broke,
her pretty face crumpled. She
sobbed into her hands. Gently,
Danny stroked her back.</p>

<hr />

<p>"There now, take it easy,"
he said. "Your father will
sail. I know he'll sail. Do you
believe the world to be round,
little Nina?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Oh yes, yes, yes!"</p>

<p>"He will sail. He will prove
it and be famous. I know he
will."</p>

<p>"Oh, Martin. You sound so
sure of yourself. I wish I
could ..."</p>

<p>"Nina, listen. Your father
will sail."</p>

<p>"You'll help us you mean?"</p>

<p>"Yes. All right, I'll help
you. Now, get some sleep if
you want to wake up and say
goodbye to him in the morning.
Because I'll be getting
him up before the sun to&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Are you a sailing man
too? Are you going with
him?"</p>

<p>"Well ..."</p>

<p>"Wait! Martin, I remember
you now. Martin Pinzon.
At the meeting of the organization
to prove the Earth's
round shape. You! You were
there. And once, once when he
was not drunk, father said
that a Don Pinzon would command
one of our three ships,
the Nina it was, the caravel
which bears my name. Are
you this Don Pinzon?"</p>

<p>Slowly, Danny nodded. He
remembered his history now.
The Nina <i>had</i> been commanded
by one Don Pinzon, Don
Martin Pinzon! And he was
now this Martin Pinzon, he,
Danny Jones. Which meant he
was going with Columbus to
discover a new world! A nineteen-year-old American youth
going to witness the single
most important event in
American history....</p>

<p>"Yes," Danny said slowly,
"I am Don Pinzon."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;but you're so
young!"</p>

<p>Danny shrugged. "I have
seen more of the world than
you would believe, Nina."</p>

<p>"The Western Sea? You
have been out on the Western
Sea, as far as the Canary Islands,
perhaps?" she asked in
an awed voice.</p>

<p>"I know the Western Sea,"
he said. "Trust me."</p>

<p>She came very close. She
looked long in his eyes. "I
trust you, Martin. Oh yes, I
trust you. Listen, Martin. I'm
going. I'm going with you. I
have to go with you."</p>

<p>"But a girl&mdash;"</p>

<p>"He is my father. I love
him, Martin. He needs me.
Martin, don't try to stop me.
I want you to help me aboard,
to see that he ... oh, Martin,
you'll have so much to do. Because
the rest of our crew&mdash;some
of them being hired
even now by the three caravel
pursers&mdash;will be a crew of
cut-throats and ne'er-do-wells
embarking into the unknown
because they have utterly
nothing to lose. Father needs
you because the others won't
care."</p>

<p>"The three caravels will
sail west," Danny told her.
"Believe me, they'll sail west.
Now, get some sleep."</p>

<p>Her face was still very
close. Her eyes filled with
tears, but they were not tears
of sadness. She took his
cheeks in her hands and
kissed him softly on the lips.
She smiled at him, her own
lips trembling.</p>

<p>"Martin," she said.</p>

<p>His arms moved. They went
around her, drew the softness
of her close. She murmured
something, but he did not
hear it. His lips found hers a
second time, fiercely. His
hands her shoulder, her
throat, her ...</p>

<p>"Flat," Columbus mumbled.
"Flat. Abs'lutely flat. The
Earth is&mdash;flat as a pancake...."</p>

<p>"Oh, Martin!" Nina cried.</p>

<hr />

<p>It was raining in the morning.
A hard, driving rain,
pelting down on the seaport
of Palos. The three caravels
floated side by side in the little
harbor and a large, derisive
crowd had gathered. The
crowd erupted into noisy
laughter when Columbus and
his little party appeared on
foot.</p>

<p>"I need a drink," Columbus
whispered. "I can't go
through with it."</p>

<p>"Father," Nina said.
"We're with you. I'm here.
Martin is here."</p>

<p>"I can't go&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've got to go through
with it! For yourself and for
the world. Now, stand
straight, father. They're looking
at you. They're all looking
at you."</p>

<p>Columbus, thought Danny.
The intrepid voyager who had
discovered a new world! He
smiled grimly. Columbus, the
history books should have
said, the drunken sot who
didn't even have the courage
to face his own convictions.</p>

<p>They walked ahead through
the ridiculing crowd. Danny's
throat was still sore. He was
not frightened, though. He
possibly was the only man in
the crew who was not frightened.
The others didn't care
what their destination was,
true: but they wanted to
reach it alive. Danny knew
the journey would end in success.
The end of the journey
meant nothing to him. It was
written in history. It was ...</p>

<p>Unless, he suddenly found
himself thinking, I came back
here to write it. He grinned at
his own bravado. What would
they have said in freshman
psych&mdash;that was practically
paranoid thinking. As if
Danny Jones, Whitney College,
Virginia, U.S.A., could
have anything to do with the
success or failure of Columbus'
journey.</p>

<p>They reached the small
skiff that would take them
out to the tiny fleet of caravels.
The crowd hooted and
jeered.</p>

<p>"... going to drop off the
edge of the world, Columbus."</p>

<p>"If the monsters don't get
you first."</p>

<p>"Or the storms and whirlpools."</p>

<p>Columbus gripped Nina's
hand. Martin-Danny took his
other arm firmly and steered
him toward the prow of the
skiff. "Easy now, skipper,"
Danny said.</p>

<p>"I can't&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There's wine on the Santa
Maria," Danny whispered.
"Much wine&mdash;to make you
forget. Come on!"</p>

<p>"And I'm going, father,"
Nina said. "Whether you go
or not."</p>

<p>"You!" Columbus gasped.
"A girl. You, going&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With Martin Pinzon. If&mdash;if
my own father can't look
after me, then Martin can."</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;" Danny began.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, please," she
whispered as Columbus
climbed stiffly into the skiff.
"It may be the only way, Martin.
He&mdash;he loves me. I guess
I'm the only thing he cares
about. If he knows I'm going."</p>

<p>"To the Santa Maria!" Columbus
told the rowers as
Danny and Nina got into the
skiff.</p>

<p>"To the New World!" cried
Danny melodramatically.</p>

<p>"What did you say?" Nina
asked him.</p>

<p>His face colored. "I mean,
to the Indies! To the Indies!"</p>

<p>The skiff bobbed out across
the harbor toward the three
waiting caravels. Departure
time had arrived.</p>

<p>Two hours later, they were
underway.</p>

<hr />

<p>The sea was calm as glass,
green as emerald. The three
caravels, after a journey of
several days, had reached the
Canary Islands where additional
provisions and fresh
water were to be had.</p>

<p>"This," said Columbus,
waving his arms to take in
the chain of islands. "This is
as far as a mere man has a
right to go. There is nothing
further, can't you see? Can't
you?"</p>

<p>He was sober. Danny had
come over in a skiff from the
Nina to see that he remained
sober at least for the loading
and the departure. It was as
if he, Danny, was going to
preserve Columbus' name for
history&mdash;single-handed if
necessary.</p>

<p>"We will not go on," Columbus
said. "We're going back.
The only way to the Indies is
around the Cape of Storms,
around Africa. I tell you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's enough, father,"
Nina said. "We ..."</p>

<p>"I'm in command here,"
Columbus told them. It surprised
Danny. Usually, the
drunken sailor was not so
self-assertive. Then it occurred
to Danny that it wasn't merely
self-assertiveness: it was
fear.</p>

<p>Danny called over the mate,
a one-legged man named
Juan, who walked with a
jaunty stride despite his peg
leg. "You take orders from
Columbus?" Danny said.
"Would you take orders from
me?"</p>

<p>Juan shook his head, smiling.
"You command aboard
the Nina only, Martin Pinzon.
I heard what the Captain
said. If he wants to go back
and give up this fool scheme,
it's all right with me. And you
know the rest of the crew will
say the same."</p>

<p>Nina looked at Danny hopelessly.
She said, "Then, then
it's no use?"</p>

<p>Danny whispered fiercely,
"Your father loves you very
much?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And doesn't want to see
anything happen to you?"</p>

<p>"But&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And believes the world is
flat and if you sail far enough
west you'll fall off?"</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then you're coming with
me aboard the Nina!"</p>

<p>Columbus gasped, "What
did you say?"</p>

<p>"She's coming with me, on
the Nina. If you don't want to
find the western route to the
Indies, we will. Right, Nina?"
he said, taking her hand and
moving to where the rope-ladder
dangled over the side
of the Santa Maria to the
skiff below.</p>

<p>"Don't take her from this
deck," Columbus ordered.</p>

<p>Danny ignored him. "Don
Juan!" cried Columbus, and
the peg-leg came toward
Danny.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry, Don Martin,"
he said, "but&mdash;"</p>

<p>Still holding Nina's hand,
Martin stiff-armed him out of
the way and ran for the side.
Someone jerked the rope-ladder
out of reach and someone
else leaped on Martin. For, he
was Martin now, Martin Pinzon.
His own identity seemed
submerged far below the surface,
as if somehow he could
look on all this without risking
anything. He knew that
he was merely a defense
mechanism, to ward off fear:
for, it wasn't true. If Martin
Pinzon were hurt, <i>he</i> would be
hurt.</p>

<p>He hurled the man from his
back. Nina screamed as a cutlass
flashed in the sun. Martin-Danny
ducked, felt the
blade whizz by overhead.</p>

<p>"Jump!" Martin-Danny
cried.</p>

<p>"But I can't swim!"</p>

<p>"I can. I'll save you." It was
Danny again, completely
Danny. He felt himself arise
to the surface, submerging
Martin Pinzon. Because the
Spaniard probably couldn't
swim at all, and if Danny
made promises, it was Danny
who must fulfill them.</p>

<p>He squeezed Nina's hand.
He went up on the side&mdash;and
over. The water seemed a
very long way down. They hit
it finally with a great splash.</p>

<p>Down they went and down,
into the warm murky green
depths. Down&mdash;and finally
up. Danny's head broke surface.
He was only yards from
the skiff. He had never let go
of Nina's hand, but now he
did, getting a lifeguard's hold
on her. He struck out for the
skiff.</p>

<hr />

<p>Fifteen minutes later, they
were aboard the Nina. "I
command here," Danny told
the crew. "Is that correct?"</p>

<p>"Aye, sir," said Don Hernan,
the mate.</p>

<p>"Even if Columbus tells you
different?"</p>

<p>"Columbus?" spat Don
Hernan. "That drunkard is in
command of the Santa Maria,
not the Nina. We follow Martin
Pinzon here."</p>

<p>"Even if I give one set of
orders and Columbus another?"</p>

<p>"Even then, my commander.
Yes."</p>

<p>"Then we're sailing west,"
Danny cried. "Up anchor!
Hurry."</p>

<p>"But I&mdash;" Nina began.</p>

<p>"Don't you see? He thinks
I'm abducting you. Or he
thinks I'm sailing west with
you to certain death. He will
follow with the Santa Maria
and the Pinta, trying to rescue
you. And we'll reach the
Indies. Columbus will sail
across the Western Sea to
save his daughter, but what's
the difference <i>why</i> he'll sail.
The important thing is, Queen
Isabella gave him the charter
and the caravels and with
them he's making history.
You see?"</p>

<p>"I ... I think so," Nina said
doubtfully.</p>

<p>A heady wind sprang up.
The square-rigged sails billowed.
The Nina began to
surge forward&mdash;into the unknown
West.</p>

<p>Tackle creaked aboard the
nearby Santa Maria and Pinta.
The two other caravels
came in pursuit. But they
won't catch us, Martin knew.
They won't catch us until we
reach&mdash;Hispaniola. And then,
pursuit will be no more. Then,
it will no longer matter and
we'll all be heroes....</p>

<hr />

<p>Which is the way it turned
out&mdash;almost.</p>

<p>The Santa Maria and Pinta
pursued all through August
and September and into October,
but the Nina kept its
slim lead. The ships were
never out of sight of one another
and once or twice Columbus
even hailed them, imploring
them to return to
Spain with him. When they
ignored him, his deep voice
boomed to his own crew and
the crew of the Pinta: "Then
sail on, sail on!" It was these
words, Danny knew, that history
would record. Not the
others.</p>

<p>One morning in October, he
awoke with a start. Something
had disturbed his sleep&mdash;something ...</p>

<p>"Good morning, captain," a
voice said.</p>

<p>He looked up. It was a giant
of a man, with a hard
face and brutal-looking eyes.
He knew that face. Pietro!
The giant of the tavern.</p>

<p>"But you&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was aboard all the time,
my captain," Pietro said. "An
auxiliary rower. You never
knew." He said nothing else.
He lunged at Martin's bunk&mdash;for
I'm Martin again, Danny
thought&mdash;a knife gleaming in
his big hand.</p>

<hr />

<p>Martin-Danny sat up,
bringing the covers with him,
hurling them like a cloak at
Pietro. The giant's knife-hand
caught in the covers and
Danny swung to his feet,
shoving the big man. Pietro
stumbled into the bunk, then
lashed around quickly, unexpectedly,
the knife loose
again. Danny felt it grating
across his ribs hotly, searingly.
He staggered and almost
fell, but somehow made it to
the door and on deck. He
needed room. Facing that
knife in the close confines of
the cabin, he was a dead man
and knew it.</p>

<p>He hit the stairs and headed
for the deck. He reached
the door&mdash;tugged. It held
fast. He heard Pietro's laughter,
then threw himself to one
side. The knife thudded into
the wood alongside Danny's
shoulder.</p>

<p>Then the door came open,
throwing him back. He stumbled,
regained his balance,
plunged outside. With a roar,
Pietro followed him, knife
again in hand.</p>

<p>Danny backed away slowly.
Only a few crew members
were on deck now, and a
watch high up in the crow's
nest. The watch was crying in
an almost-delirious voice:
"Land, land! Land ho-oo!"
But Martin-Danny hardly
heard the words. Pietro came
at him&mdash;</p>

<p>Suddenly Don Hernan was
in front of him. Don Hernan's
hand nipped up and then
down and a knife arced toward
Danny. He caught it by
the haft, swung to face the
giant. But, he thought, I don't
know how to use a knife. I'm
Danny Jones, I ...</p>

<p>Pietro leaped, the knife
down, held loosely at his side,
underhanded, ready to slash
and rip. Danny sidestepped
and Pietro went by in a rush.
Danny waited.</p>

<p>Pietro came back carefully
this time, crouching, balanced
easily on the balls of his feet.
For all his size, he fought
with the grace of a dancer.</p>

<p>Danny felt warm wetness
where the blood was seeping
from his ribs. Feet pounded
as more of the crew came on
deck in response to the
watch's delirious words. Instead
of crowding at the
prow, though, they formed a
circle around Danny and
Pietro. Danny thought: But
I'm the captain. The captain.
They ought to help me ...
they ... He knew though that
they would not. They were a
fierce, proud people and the
law of single combat would
apply even to the captain who
had piloted them across an
unknown ocean.</p>

<p>Pietro came by, attempting
to slash with his knife from
outside. Danny moved quickly&mdash;not
quick enough. The knife
point caught his arm this
time. He felt his hand go
numb. His own knife clattered
to the deck as blood
oozed from his biceps.</p>

<p>Once more Pietro charged
him. Weaponless, Danny waited.
Pietro was laughing, sure
of himself&mdash;</p>

<p>Careless.</p>

<p>Danny slipped aside as
Pietro brought the knife
around in a wicked swipe. He
spun with it and when he
came around Danny was waiting
for him. He drove his left
fist into the great belly and
his right to the big, bearded
jaw. Pietro slumped, disbelief
in his eyes. He swung the
knife again but only succeeded
in wrapping his giant arm
around Danny. He bent his
head, shook it to clear it of
the sting of Danny's blows.
And Danny rabbit-punched
him.</p>

<p>Pietro went down heavily
and someone shouted. "The
face! Kick him in the face!"</p>

<p>Wearily, Danny shook his
head. He went with Nina to
the rail and saw the green
palm-fringed island of the
New World. Nina smiled at
him, then ripped something
from what she was wearing
and began to bandage his
ribs, his arm.</p>

<hr />

<p>They heard a splash. Danny
looked around, saw Don Hernan
and a member of the crew
gazing serenely down. Pietro
was down there, where they
had tossed him. For a while
the body floated, then the
limbs splashed wildly as
Pietro regained consciousness.
He drifted back away
from the ship. He went under,
and came up. He went under
again, and stayed under....</p>

<p>"The Indies," Nina said.</p>

<p>"The Indies," Danny said.
He did not make the distinction
between east and west.
They must learn for themselves.</p>

<p>The Pinta and the Santa
Maria came up alongside. All
thoughts of pursuit were
gone. Columbus waved. He
was very close now on the
deck of the Santa Maria.
There was something in his
face, something changed. Columbus
was a new man now.
He had been shamed. He had
followed his daughter and
Martin Pinzon across an unknown
ocean and he was
changed now. Somehow, Danny
knew he could now make
voyages on his own.</p>

<p>"Martin," Nina whispered.
"They may say it was father.
But it was you. I'll know in
my heart, it was you."</p>

<p>Danny nodded. She put her
arm around his shoulder, and
kissed him. He liked this slim
girl&mdash;he liked her immensely,
and it wasn't right. She
wasn't his, not really. She was
Martin Pinzon's. He let the
Spaniard come to the surface,
willed his own mind back and
down and away. She's all
yours, Pinzon, he told the
other mind in his body. She&mdash;and
this world. I'm a&mdash;stranger
here.</p>

<p>But once more he kissed
Nina, fiercely, with passion
and longing.</p>

<p>"Goodbye, my darling," he
said.</p>

<p>"Goodbye! What&mdash;"</p>

<p>He let Martin Pinzon take
it from there. "Hello," said
Martin Pinzon. "I mean, hello
forever, darling."</p>

<p>She laughed. "Goodbye to
your bachelorhood, you
mean."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "Yes."</p>

<p>But it was Martin Pinzon
talking now. Completely Martin
Pinzon.</p>

<p>He was back in his grand-uncle's
basement. He was in
the trunk and he felt stiff.
Mostly, his right arm and the
right ribs felt stiff. He felt
his shirt. It was caked with
blood.</p>

<p>Proof, he thought. If I
needed proof. What happened
to Pinzon happened to me.</p>

<p>He stood up. He felt weak,
but knew he would be all
right. He knew about Columbus
now. At first, a weak
drunkard. But after the first
voyage, thanks to Martin Pinzon
and Nina, an intrepid
voyager. For history said Columbus
would make four voyages
to the New World&mdash;and
four he would make.</p>

<p>Danny went outside, to
where the lawyer was waiting
for him. The trunk was Danny's
now, the time trunk. And
he would use it again, often.
He knew that now, and it was
wrong to deflate a dream.</p>

<p>Columbus was a hero. He
would never say otherwise
again.</p>
